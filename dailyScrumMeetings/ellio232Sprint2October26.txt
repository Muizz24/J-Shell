What did I work on in the last 3 days?
	- Created DirectoryStack class and a pop and push methods for it
	- Commented the code for DirectoryStack
	- Created DirectoryPush class, though it is incomplete

What do I plan to work on in the next 3 days?
	- Complete code for DirectoryPush class
	- Comment DirectoryPush
	- Do javadocs for DirectoryChange

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Just need to confirm what values can be accessed for DirectoryPush
