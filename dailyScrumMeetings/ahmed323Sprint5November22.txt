

What did I work on in the last three days?
		- Make Test Cases for most commands
		- Removed redirection being embedded in echo and put it in RedirectSystem

What do I plan to work in the next four days?
		- Make Test Cases for Redirect's static methods.
		- Polish and clean code overall.

Am I blocked on anything?
		- Group is lacking on some work but overall progress is okay
