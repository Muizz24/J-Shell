What did I work on in the last 3 days?
	- corrected implementation of DirectoryChange based on the up to date implementation of other classes
	- discussed and finalized CRC cards with team members

What do I plan to work on in the next 3 days?
	- create a DirectoryStack which will be necessary for DirectoryPush and DirectoryPop classes
	- allow pushing to and popping from a stack created in DirectoryStack
	- possibly start on implementation of the DirectoryPush class

Am I blocked on anything?
	- no, nothing is preventing me from starting on my necessary tasks
