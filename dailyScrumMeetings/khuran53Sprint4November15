What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Created and set up Getter so that it can retrieve the data from a file
	at a given URL.
	- Created and set up Saver so that it gets the command history, and saves 
	it as a file at the desired path on the user's laptop.
	- Edited Command and JShell so that they allow for the addition of Getter
	and Setter
	
	

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Comment and finish Getter.
	- Comment Saver.
	- Create and finish Loader.
	

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not currently blocked anywhere.
