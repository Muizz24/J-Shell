What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Set up Parser so that it takes the user's input and sends it to Validator.
	- Created and coded Validator so that it calls the corresponding command
	according to the user's input.
	- Coded Validator to make sure that the user's input is correctly formatted
	and represents a proper path or directory if required.
	

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Create and finish Man.
    - Make sure Validator works properly with exception handling.
    

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not currently blocked anywhere.
