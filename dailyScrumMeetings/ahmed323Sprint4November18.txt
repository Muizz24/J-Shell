		- Added JavaDocs and Comments for tree, L[-R], find and RedirectSystem
		- Polish code more for better software design
		- Removed redirection being embedded in echo 

What do I plan to work in the next four days?
		- Make Test Cases for most commands and Redirect's static methods
		- Removed redirection being embedded in echo and put it in RedirectSystem

Am I blocked on anything?
		- Not anything at the moment. Group is at a good pace :)
