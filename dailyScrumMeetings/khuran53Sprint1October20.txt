What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Figured out overall design idea with the rest of the team.
    - Went to Abbas's office hours (as a team) and learned how to improve our
    design.
    - Worked on JShell (Scanning and asking user for input).
    - Finished exit command through JShell.
    

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish JShell.
    - Try to see if I can implement exit as its own class, rather than a
    part of JShell.
    - Figure out new tasks for sprint 2.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not currently blocked anywhere, just have been a bit busy with other 
	courses and commitments so I haven't been able to finish everything for
	this sprint yet.
