What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Figured out a new design format which changes the way we parse user input,
    breaking it down into a translator and validator class.
    

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish JShell.
    - Implement exit as its own class.
    - Begin working on the code for translator and validator classes.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not currently blocked anywhere, just have been a bit busy with other 
	courses and commitments and we changed the design today so there was no
	need for me to change the code I had previously worked from.
