What did I work on in the last 3 days?
	- worked on ChangeDirectory implementation for
	  relative and full paths
	- discussed with team on Directory implementation

What do I plan to work on in the next 3 days?
	- ChangeDirectory implementation for parent path (..)
	- Handling of invalid paths for ChangeDirectory
	- possibly improve current structure of ChangeDirectory
	Edit : - add javadocs to ChangeDirectory class

Am I blocked on anything?
