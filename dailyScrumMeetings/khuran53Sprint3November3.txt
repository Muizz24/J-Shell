What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Created the Man class.
	- Made sure Validator works properly with most commands exception handling.
	- Redesigned Validator, Parser, and JShell to work with the new Command 
	casting.
	
	

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish implementing the printDocumentation for all the commands so that
    Man works.
    - Make sure that Validator finds all of the possible exceptions and gets
    the correct corresponding ExceptionHandler class.

    

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not currently blocked anywhere.
