What did I work on in the last 3 days?
	- Fixed problems with implementation of Copy and Move classes
	- Adjusted test cases for DirectoryChange and DirectroyPush
	  as needed
	- Completed test cases for DirectoryPop

What do I plan to work on in the next 3 days?
	- Javadocs for Move and Copy classes
	- Test cases for all personal unfinished classes (DirectoryStack, Copy
	  and Move)

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I do not believe anything is standing in the way of me completing my
	  responsibilities
