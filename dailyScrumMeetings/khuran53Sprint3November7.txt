What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Finished implementing the printDocumentation for all the commands so that
    Man works.
    - Made sure that Validator finds all of the possible exceptions and gets
    the correct corresponding ExceptionHandler class.
    - Updated Exit so that Exit extends command and can run_command and 
    print_documentation.
    - Changed Parser so that the commands will still run even if the user
     doesn't input it in all lowercase.
    - Finished commenting, polishing, and adding honour code.
