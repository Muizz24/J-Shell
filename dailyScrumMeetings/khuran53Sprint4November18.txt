What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Finished setting up Saver so that it gets all of the command history, and 
	saves it as a file at the desired path on the user's laptop (regardless of
	whether it is a mac or windows, or whether it is not the Desktop - which
	were the problems I encountered last scrum).
	- Created and set up Loader so that it retrieves and reads the file at
	the desired path on the user's computer.
	
	

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Comment Getter and set it up so that it works with Echo.
	- Comment Saver and test it.
	- Comment Loader get it to work with the new runCommand system.
	

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not currently blocked anywhere.
