What did I work on in the last 3 days?
	- Implementation of Move class (most cases)
	- Added comments for Move
	- Added exception handling for DirectoryChange

What do I plan to work on in the next 3 days?
	- Finish implementation of mv FILE FILE and CP FILE FILE
	- Javadocs for Copy and Move classes
	- Complete testing for classes that still need test cases

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I do not believe anything is standing in the way of me completing my
	  responsibilities
