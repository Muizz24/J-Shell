# J-Shell
Mocked command line interface on Java's console with multiple commands such as cat, echo, touch and more listed below on a artificial FileSystem. The code was done with a group of 4 friends (including me) through a 4 month agile scrum method.

Commands available:
  -find: Command that finds if a specific file or directory with name in quotations exists in the given path's directories.
  
  -history: Prints out all the input the user has been giving, including typos and lines with wrong syntax.
  
  -cp: This is the corresponding class for the command cp, which copies the contents from a given OLDPATH into a given NEWPATH.
  
  -cd: This class corresponds to the cd method, which changes the current working directory to the directory DIR, when an input in the            format, "cd DIR", is entered.
  
  -ls: Command in Jshell that prints a Dir's contents in the Filesystem.
  
  -mkdir: Command in Jshell that makes new Directories in the FileSystem.
  
  -pwd: Command in Jshell that prints current working dir in the FileSystem.
  
  -exit: A command in JShell that exits the entire program and stops requesting input from the user once it is called.
  
  -pushd: 
  -popd
  -echo
  -tree
  -man
  -mv
  -touch
  -cat
  -save
  -load
