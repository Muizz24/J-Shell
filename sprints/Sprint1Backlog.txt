-----EDITS-----
-Changed the name of class DirectoryTree to FileSystem. (10/20/2018 8:50PM)
-c3 not needed. (10/23/2018 4:46PM)
-Fixed grammar. Changed "Allow user" to "As a user" for consistency purposes. (unknown)
-b3 removed because change directory isn't going to do any parsing. (10/23/2018 4:46PM)
